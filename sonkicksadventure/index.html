    <p>Sonkick was resting in his house, and when he woke up, he found that his forklift certificate was missing! (in this world, you need to show people your forklift certificate in order to drive one.) he suddenly found clues to whoever must've done it. While still pondering, some bird gave him a message coming from some jealous eggheaded bozo. Now he's off to an adventure. A sonkick adventure if you will. (A 13 map adventure).</p>
